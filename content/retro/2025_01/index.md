## Goals
### Run A Lot
- **Preparation**: Increasing the amount of runs that I perform to follow my marathon plan.
- **Results**: I probably ran once this whole month, while this was an initial goal I did nothing in this regard...
- **Grade**: D

### Find A Job
- **Specification**: Hammering out applications to spots where I would like to work in the future.
- **Results**: During this month I switched to the civil service from the military and asked around regarding a possible PhD, as well as communicated that I am looking to go into consultancy. Overall a progression, but little tangible results.
- **Grade**: C

### Finish Website

## Some Stories
### A Trip that ought to be rememebered
...

### Getting Trolled by Github Copilot
When implementing Spotify embedding in the form of an *iFrame* I used the song **Juicy Money** from *Shirin David* as a default value. I was expecting to also get suggested this song when I wanted to try deploying it the first time. However Github Copilot suggested me the song: **Never Gonna Give You Up** from *Rick Astley*.

### Skydiving with Dad
for his 60th birthday I gifted my dad skydiving and whilst he wasn't too happy he about it he yielded to destiny. So this January we went together to Interlaken to take our first jump, which was absolutely ludicrous! Whilst I was majorly afraid when jumping out of the plane, my dad was completely unfazed! Stating calmly after arriving back on Earth that he will not do this again ^^

Follow you can see a video of myself almost shatting my pants when we started. Because there is a person in the back you feel so lost and not in control... But the adrenaline spike was so well worth it!!
