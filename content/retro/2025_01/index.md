## Some Stories
### Getting Trolled by Github Copilot
When implementing Spotify embedding in the form of an *iFrame* I used the song **Juicy Money** from *Shirin David* as a default value. I was expecting to also get suggested this song when I wanted to try deploying it the first time. However Github Copilot suggested me the song: **Never Gonna Give You Up** from *Rick Astley*.
