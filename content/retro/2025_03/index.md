## Goals
### Front Split

- **Results**: off and on regarding the front splits, but overall I see an improvement. I can cave in my back knee more, stabilizing me in the lower position. Currently, missing about a fist of space before I get down.
- **Grade**: A

### Organize Civil Service

- **Results**: this is a big one. I landed a really cool position at the "Snow and Avalanche Institute" in Davos building software as a service :)
- **Grade**: S

### Reading a new book.

- **Results**: My book "Narziss & Goldmund" was stolen when I was skying, which completely bummed me out! However, I recovered by reading other books from Hermann Hesse!!
- **Grade**: B

### Be less on phone.

- **Results**: UIUIUIUI! Miserable... I spent so much time on Youtube and Netflix in the last month, it is crazy! Now I have setup _again_ a timer for these apps.
- **Grade**: D

### Get a job.

- **Results**: Let's not talk about it...
- **Grade**: D

## Some Stories
### Friendship Flavours
Just recently I got into a bit of a scuffle with Noah. We were pushing each others' buttons the whole night and were really getting on each others' nerves until in the end we ended up leaving a bar to punch each other. Hands down, no defense, just a clean shot into the stomach.
