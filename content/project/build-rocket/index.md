Embarking on the challenge of building a rocket has been one of the most exhilarating projects of my life. From brainstorming designs to assembling components, the journey has been filled with learning, perseverance, and moments of awe. There's something incredibly humbling about turning an ambitious idea into a tangible, working machine. This project is not just about engineering; it's about dreaming big and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

Building a rocket is a blend of science, creativity, and grit. Here's what I’ve learned along the way:

- **Patience is Key:** Complex projects like this take time and precision.
- **Teamwork Matters:** Collaborating with others brought fresh perspectives and innovative solutions.
- **Failure is a Teacher:** Each setback was an opportunity to refine the design and improve.
