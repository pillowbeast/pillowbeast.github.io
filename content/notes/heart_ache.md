## Obsession vs. Attention
I believe that whenever a girl gives me attention, meaning I feel like I can 'have' them, I am not that attracted to them. It happened over and over again, that when I feel interested in a girl, because they show me sides of life that I have no way to get to and they do nto want me I get more and more into them. I have recently met two women like that and the feeling of rejection is so tough on me, it really weighs me down. Usually if somebody is very different than me I feel interested in learning about their way of life and their challenges. When somebody is too similar I do not feel attracted as it feels like they are walking on the same path as me, but I am just walking faster or better or smarter. Or I feel like I am competing with them, and I really do not like the feeling of being in a competition with the person that I want to love adn spend my time with, it should much rather be an experience that extends both of our horizons, fostering understanding. And therefore we can really dig deep into the hobbies that we do share or where there is overlap to elevate us to the next level!

## Deaf Ears
I really do not like learning about people that are following in the same steps, in my head I am too often drawing the comparison to my own life and putting everything they say on the scale. Would I do this as well? Do I agree with this? Are they better at this than me? A possible explanation for thsi way of life that I can think of is that I don't set goals, so whatever I pick up I am pretty good at (because I usually try hard in the beginning). So when I hear about somebody's life then I can always really engage and try hard myself without the possiblity of failure. 

## Mute
Also I generally do not talk too much about the actual outcomes of my work, because I often do not set goals, so I just do until I am 'done doing'. Whilst doing I would tell people that I am doing, but then after I am done doing, maybe because I do not want to fail I just do not talk about it anymore. I count it as a loss and I sweep it under the carpet, never to be heard and seen again. So instead of talking about what you are doing currently and how cool it is, I should also reserve a portion of my conversations about what I have done in the past and really learn to tell people what I have learned and what I enjoyed. The information that they get from such conversations build trust, because they can learn how I am and how I react to situations. There are of course negative moments that may have a strong impact on my history and I am trying to sweep these away, but I should learn to cherish the good moments and also learn to communicate these moments. Both knowledge and feelings have a place in these conversations, funny moments, sad moments, moments that made you angry, proud moments, achievements, challenges, also the small things, petting a dog by the sea, hiking a passage with some other hikers, drinking a beer with the shepards, etc.
