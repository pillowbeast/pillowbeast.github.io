## And what do you want this year?

Usually you get hit with this question 1 to 2 months before your birthday or christmas and of course you somehow forgot all the nice things that you have longed for for months. You stumble something about love and time with your friends and family. Then christmas rolls around and you get a pair of socks and you put on a wide smile and thank everybody for the great gifts this year. If you also know this feeling you will understand why I am generating a permanent wishlist, so that people can just look up here what I require.
