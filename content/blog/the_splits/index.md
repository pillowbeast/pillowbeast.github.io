## Why?
I would like to be able to do the front split (and maybe eventually the middle splits). The reason is that I think if I can perform the splits I have a great baseline functionality in my core and hips, as well as range of motion in my hamstrings. Since I was a small boy I always wanted to be able to do the front splits, but I never followed through. Side Quest: I feel like I never really followed through with anything, there was never the goal of achieving something in my mind, never a true goal. It was always just a path to getting better, but I never put the repetitions in to get surprisingly good at something. So this is I guess a redemption arch to get good enough at the front split.

## How?
Currently I stumbled across a split app, it is called **Bend**. The app provides a 10-20 minute free split workout and my goal is to follow through with that one. Of course like always these pre-made tailored workouts and apps they do not refelct the personal needs, so whilst I will take some inspiration from that training I will mainly be focusing on my own needs.

I have already made some considerable progress when just strechting myself. However, I need to make sure that I do not overstretch, as the DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness) made it impossible to stretch my left hamstring for 1.5 weeks. I really overdid it, I felt a small muscle in my hamstring snapping, just liek a small piece of string being pulled apart - just quickly **pulled my left hamstring** by stretching... Sadge. Now as this is getting better the idea is to tackle it again. I will be trying to focus on a combination of passive and active split stretching, as the active part is needed to hold my body in a healthy position (especially the upper body) and the passive part is required so that I teach my muscles that it is okay to exceed the previous range of motion. I will take some pictures today so that I can track my progress.

## Literature Research
Reading up on other blogs and journeys towards the splits I stumbled across [Elaine's Journey](https://www.journeytomobility.com/front-splits-journey/) towards the splits. Whilst I do start at a bit of a more flexible point, I think there are several poitns that I can benefit from! Firstly, **warmign up** makes all the difference and **measurements** should be taken at the **end of session**. There is no reason to push yourself, as your body has to get comfortable in the new range of motion, which means **flexibility requires consistency**.

## Status Quo

### January 2025
This is where I am right now:
