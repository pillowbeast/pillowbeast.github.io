## Dilemma
Currently I am in a week where I do not work on my Master Thesis, because I do not feel like it, because I had quite an exhausting push last week, also I really enjoy doing other things, learning new things and especially building tools that I can use in my day-to-day life. These learning experiences that give me a super fun time and also that in the end produce a product that is not life-changing, but that I can cherish because I did it myself and I draw use out of them in my day-to-day life.

This week my sole focus was on building a language learning app, this gets me closer to understanding backend development, toosl liek Figma, for frontend development/app development and other skills like project planning. Whilst I am probably losing valuable time on my Masterthesis I think it is well worth it in the end to take a breather right here.
