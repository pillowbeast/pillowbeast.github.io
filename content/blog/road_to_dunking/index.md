## Starting Grounds

So where are we right now!?

I canÂ´t dunk, at 192cm I cannot dunk and I have never dunked in my entire life.[^1] I can touch the rim I can grab rebounds, I can push, run climb, but I cannot dunk. It is not like I have really invested time into being able to dunk, but it was always a goal of mine.

## Exercises

My primary resource is the [_Coach Mac Vertical Jump Program_](https://www.basketballforcoaches.com/vertical-jump/). Coach Mac perfectly breaks down the jumping program into three cycles of four weeks each.

[^1]: I have dunked exactly once, with the help of a 15 year old dude in an Adonis body. That kid was dunking like crazy on the Oerlikon basketball courts and took pity upon myself... And I did dunk, once, and then never again.
