When spending my weeks in Darmstadt at ESA I met this lovely Italian woman. Enticed by the Italian culture and way of life I got into Pasta for the first time in my life. Don't understand me wrong, Pasta is good, but I never thought it was great. However, learning from her the recipes that were passed down by her mother and nonna was so fulfilling and opened up a whole new culinary horizon to me. 

The following Bolognese recipe is a true gem, both savory, sweet and rich in taste it is being carried by the delicacy of ingredient selection. The Italian cuisine is a master of meats and cheeses, choosing the perfect salty and herb combination to create immense depth in the dishes. The combination of Pancetta (or better Guanciale) with a 60% beef and 40% pork mix creates such an intense base that is enhanced by high quality vegetables and the Pecorino cheese.

Overall **I am in love** with this recipe.
