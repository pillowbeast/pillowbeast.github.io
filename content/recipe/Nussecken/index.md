## The Origin


{{< inline-img src="images/nussecken_caramel_layer.png" caption="delicate caramel layer" alignment="right" max-width="40%" >}} 
The Nussecken are generally prepared and eaten from the Schwabenl√§ndle up until Hessen. A heavy, sweet, nutty desert that leaves all wishes fulfilled. You're craving chocolate, done! You're craving a crispy honey glaze, done! Nuts, done!

There is **simply nothing better** than a Nussecke after a long day outside. Be it after a hike or after spending some hours strolling through the city.{{</ inline-img >}}
